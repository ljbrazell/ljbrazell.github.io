    <h2>Design Critieria</h2>

    <p> Objective is to learn about if-else statements. Design a program to play the game Pig.
    </p>

    <h3>Design Constraints</h3>
    <p>Rules of Pig:
      Each turn, a player repeatedly rolls a die until either a 1 is rolled or the player holds and scores the sum of the rolls (i.e. the turn total). At any time during a player's turn, the player is faced with two options: Roll or Hold.
       Roll: If the player rolls a 1, the player scores nothing for this turn, and it becomes the next player's turn.
      If the player rolls a number 2 - 6, the number on the die is added to the player's turn total, and the player's turn continues.
      Hold:
      The playerâ€™s turn total is added to the player's overall score, and it becomes the next player's turn.
      The first player to score 100 or more points wins.
    </p>

    <h4> Procedure </h4>

    <img src="Images/Pig%20Pic1.PNG" alt="Pig1"     style="width:400px;height:400px;">

    <p>
      When it starts, the program will set all variables but the turn to 0. Turn will be 1. 

      When it is someone's turn, it'll roll the dice and and show what number it landed on. 
    </p>

    <img src="Images/Pig%20Pic2.PNG" alt="Pig2"     style="width:650px;height:550px;">

    <p> When playing with two players, it'll do what the comments on the left say. If the 'When I receive Hold' is connected to the right set of blocks, it includes a third player. </p>

    <img src="Images/Pig%20Pic3.PNG" alt="Pig3"     style="width:550px;height:400px;">

    <p>
      This set of blocks is necessary if you want the computer to play. 
    </p>

    <img src="Images/Pig%20Pic4.PNG" alt="Pig4"     style="width:550px;height:400px;">

    <p>
      As part of the rules, the winner is the player who gets to 100 or more points. The game will play until player 1 or 2 reaches 100.
    </p>
    
    <img src="Images/Pig%20Pic5.PNG" alt="Pig5"     style="width:550px;height:400px;">
    
    <p>
      When the hold button is clicked, it will broadcast Hold. Once Hold is received, it will move on to the next player.
    </p>
    <img src="Images/Pig%20Pic6.PNG" alt="Pig6"     style="width:550px;height:400px;">
    <p>
      When the button Roll is clicked, it will broadcast Roll. Once roll is received it will roll the dice and generate a new number.
    </p>
    
    <img src="Images/Pig%20Pic7.PNG" alt="Pig7"     style="width:550px;height:400px;">
    

    <p>
      Here is the final product. As you can see, there is a Hold and Roll button, as well as a dice. The boxes with numbers in the orange are the variables that are set in the block-code. They show/keep track of the scores and turn for you. 
    </p>

      Errors
    </h5>
    <p>
      I had errors occur when trying to add a third player and the computer.
